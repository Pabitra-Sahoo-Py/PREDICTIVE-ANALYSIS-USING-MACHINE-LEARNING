## TASK DESCRIPTION

üìå Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my Data Analyst internship task to build a machine learning classification model that predicts outcomes based on a given dataset. I used the famous Iris dataset, which includes measurements of iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, etc.) and their species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

The objective was to:

Perform feature selection

Train a classification model

Evaluate the model and visualize the results

üìÅ Dataset
The dataset was taken in .csv format and loaded using Pandas. It includes:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Species (target variable)

üîß Tools & Libraries Used
Python, Pandas

Scikit-learn ‚Äì Model training and evaluation

Plotly Express ‚Äì Visualization

Jupyter Notebook ‚Äì For development and documentation

üîç Workflow Summary
Data Preprocessing:

Checked for missing values and outliers

Converted categorical labels to numerical using LabelEncoder

Model Training:

Implemented Logistic Regression

Achieved 100% accuracy on test data (as shown in the decision boundary plot)

Evaluation:

Used accuracy, classification report, and visual decision boundaries

üìä Dashboard Output

The chart clearly shows how the model separates the classes with distinct decision boundaries using Sepal Length and Sepal Width.

‚úÖ Outcome
The project demonstrates the complete pipeline from loading data to evaluating a classification model, along with interactive visualization. It strengthened my practical understanding of supervised learning and data visualization.
